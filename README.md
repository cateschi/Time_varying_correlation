# Estimation of time-varying state correlations in state space models

This repository contains the R and C++ codes that can be used to replicate the results obtained in the paper "Estimation of time-varying state correlations in state space models" by Caterina Schiavoni, Siem Jan Koopman, Franz Palm, Stephan Smeekes and Jan van den Brakel.


## R script *TV_corr.R*

This R script should be run in order to replicate the analyses, since it calls the *TV_corr.cpp* script. It contains the following functions:
* *Weights*: it creates the cubic splines weights, and ouputs 
* 

## C++ script *TV_corr.cpp*
